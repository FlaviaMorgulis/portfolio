  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I’m driven by learning, problem-solving, and building meaningful customer
    experiences. I’m a fast learner by nature and thrive in environments where I
    can quickly understand new domains, ask the right questions, and turn
    complexity into clarity. I enjoy tackling problems end-to-end—from
    identifying user needs to designing and improving solutions that make a
    tangible difference. Creating smooth, thoughtful customer experiences isn’t
    just about usability for me; it’s a way to support business outcomes,
    strengthen relationships, and help organisations grow sustainably.
