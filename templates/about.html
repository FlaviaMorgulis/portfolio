  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Flavia! I'm a cloud- and DevOps-focused software engineer with a
    passion for building reliable, scalable, and user-centered systems. I
    specialize in backend development, relational databases, and full-stack
    projects, using Python, Flask, SQL, and Linux.
  </p>
  <p>
    I approach technology with a product mindset — translating complex
    requirements into practical solutions that work for real users. My hands-on
    projects range from financial tracking apps to system monitoring tools,
    where I've applied Agile practices, infrastructure automation, and
    data-driven decision-making.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before moving into tech, I gained extensive experience in business,
    operations, and leadership. This background helps me understand the bigger
    picture: how systems support teams, products, and customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm constantly learning and experimenting, whether it's building DevOps
    pipelines, refining data models, or exploring cloud automation. I enjoy
    solving problems, collaborating across teams, and creating systems that are
    both functional and maintainable.
  </p>
