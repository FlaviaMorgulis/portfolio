  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Flavia! I'm a former business owner with a strong background in
    operations, customer relationships, and administration. Over the years, I've
    learned how to solve problems, manage complex projects, and build strong
    connections—skills that I now bring into the tech world.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently upskilling in cloud computing, software engineering, and
    data-driven technology, with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and AWS. I
    love turning challenges into solutions, whether that's building a clean,
    efficient piece of code, analyzing data to uncover insights, or optimizing
    workflows.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm passionate about using technology to create meaningful impact and
    improve people's experiences. On this portfolio, you'll find some of my
    projects that showcase my journey from business operations into tech, as
    well as the skills I've developed along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm always curious, always learning, and excited to collaborate on projects
    that make a difference.
  </p>
